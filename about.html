                    <h1>&starf; About Us =(^w^= &starf;</h1>
                    <p>Hi! we're the Lost Time System! We're a fictive-heavy system with a fascination for tech.</p>
                    <p>We're a graphic designer, and we used to also moonlight as a VTuber named K.O.D.A.</a></p>
                    <p>We're transgender, plural, and proudly autistic.</p>
                    <p>We currently run a public webforum, at <a href="https://forum.phantomthieves.net">Forum.PhantomThieves.net.</a></p>
                    <hr class="fancyline">
                    <p>We've always had an appreciation for the lightweight and simple. But as time marches on, the
                        ever-increasing bloated landscape of the modern internet continues to abandon the machines of the
                        past.</p>
                    <p>We strive to keep The Jukebox simple and lightweight, without sacrificing style. We aim to keep it a
                        pleasant stop for all users, regardless of tech spec.</p>
                    <p>And with the capitalistic hellscape of Web 2.0 slowly eating away at what little charm the internet
                        truly has left, we advocate for truly decentralized solutions to help keep a flourishing network of
                        beautiful art and inspiring self-expression alive.</p>
                    <hr class=fancyline>
