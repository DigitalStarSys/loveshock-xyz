                <h1>Update Log: January 1, 2022</h1>
                 <p> Happy New Year, everyone!</p>
                 <p>If this is your first time logging into The Jukebox, I'd like to say welcome to you! I hope you enjoy your stay here.</p>
                 <p>For those who are returning, welcome to The Jukebox 3.0, the third visual refresh.</p>
                 <p>I started conceptualizing and designing The Jukebox a year ago, on New Year's Day, 2020. Born out of a passion for the technological days of old, The Jukebox quickly grew to become a personal playground for learning and trying HTML and CSS, giving me a new home for my works and allowing more freedom with how I portray my content.</p>
                 <p>While I didn't get to finish everything I wanted to - for example, the Sonic Forces review - due to time constraints, I'm incredibly proud of what I have achieved, both on and outside of The Jukebox.</p>
                 <p>That being said, I do hope to continue to produce more things in the next year! In the meantime, here's a quick rundown of what's changed with The Jukebox 3.0!</p>
                 <h1>Changelog</h1>

                 <h1>Closing notes</h1>
                 <p>It's been a crazy, crazy year for me, and 2022 will only bring more curveballs, most likely. A huge thank you to everyone who has supported me during 2021. Whether you read a post on The Jukebox, came to a KohakuLS stream, or even just said hi, thank you so much for making this year a special one.</p>
                 <p>On January 6th, 2022, the MacYak PowerPC challenge will begin, and I will be participating and producing content for it. On top of that, on January 13th, 2022, I will be making my official debut as Kohaku Aishogeki on Twitch. Please keep an eye out for new things in the future!</p>
                 <p>With good luck, on to 2022!</p>
                 <p>Amber out.</p>
