        <h1>Update Log: January 11, 2021</h1>
        <p>This is the first post on this blog, finally. I think I've ironed out most of the site's kinks (except for centering the navbar. Still working on that). Finally got the blog page finished and stuff too, so hopefully all that I have left to do is to implement some posts and the organizational system to make finding posts easier. I'm worried things are going to spiral out of control the more posts I write, so I aim to make them easier to access and find on the main blog page.</p>
        <p>Do please excuse the strange site hiccups here and there. I learned HTML and CSS in the span of like, twenty-four hours just to make this site, and I'd like to argue that I did okay for a first-timer, ha.</p>
        <p>There's still some things I want to accomplish. This site could look prettier, more life, instead of the overall very static aesthetic it's currently dealing with. Obviously, that relies on me to sort of get up to speed with the workings of HTML and CSS code, but that shouldn't take too much longer the more I dig and poke around with it.</p>
        <p>That's all I really have to say for right now. There are pages to work on and designs to conjure up, although I plan to have a new post up within the coming days.</p>
        <p>Thanks for taking the time to read all this. See you in the next one!</p>
        <p>Amber out.</p>
