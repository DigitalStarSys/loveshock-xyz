                <h1>Update Log: April 10, 2021</h1>
                <p>Long time no see. Sorry for being so inactive here, lately. It's been hard to find time or motivation to post anything here. I've written some stuff maybe worthy of a blog post, but haven't had the drive to do anything. Luckily, I've started making a bunch of changes to this site that should help improve things.</p>
                <P>I've made many minor tweaks, and hope to continue making major ones throughout the coming days. Do not be surprised if there are multiple update logs over this coming weekend.</P>
                <p>Biggest addition so far - added a new Specs page! This wasn't actually added in this current update, it's been here for two months now, but I thought it might be nice to have. I talk tech a lot, so I deduced it'd be nice to have a list of my equipment for those who are interested. I'll try to keep it updated, but I like tinkering, so things like operating systems change all the time.</p>
                <p>As for minor tweaks, I've changed what name I primarily go by, and pages have been modified to reflect this, including older blog posts. This probably isn't the first time this will happen, I just hope it's still not too difficult by the time that comes around, haha.</p>
                <p>Some wording on the home page has been updated, and the about page has undergone a minor overhaul. It will most likely be receiving a lot of attention from me over the coming days, as I want a place to be able to dump my interests and albums and whatnot. I think it'd be fun.</p>
                <p>I might also add a dedicated interests page, but I'm still not sure! I have a lot of ideas of things I'd love to do to this place, but admittedly, they're either major overhauls that would require a complete re-write of the site (which I just don't have the time or patience for at this point in my life), or redundant. I don't wanna add too many pages, either - that menu bar may get cramped...but, hey, maybe I go and mess with CSS. Give this site a visual tweak-up. I like the current aesthetic, but a visual refresh is always fun.</p>
                <p> If there's anything you guys would like to see from me, shoot me a DM on Twitter (handle is @KODA_VT at time of writing). Would love some suggestions.</p>
                <p>That's all for this specific update log. There will probably be one or two more at least coming soon, but I figured I'd give you all some catch-up.</p>
                <p>See you soon!</p>
                <p>Twi out.</p>
