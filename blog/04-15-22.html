                <h1>Update Log: April 15, 2022</h1>
                 <p> Hi everyone! It's been a while!</p>
                 <p>First off, thank you very much for 50,000 views! It's surreal to me that so many people want to come click on my cute little site. ;v; It means a lot!</p>
                 <p>This update log will probably change throughout the day, as I continue to work on it. I just wanted to let people know that, yes, the Jukebox is alive! I'm sorry for the lack of updates. Things have been really busy and I've had to put my creative energy somewhere else (streaming). I've been meaning to come back to the Jukebox!</p>
