                <h1>Update Log: May 17, 2021</h1>
                <p>Just some overall minor changes to the site. Here's what's new and what's changed.</p>
                <p>My Jamz page: there's now a page dedicated to my music! Complete with a widget to see what I've been listening to, lists of my favorite albums and artists, and links to my Spotify, last.fm, and my playlist. Nothing big, but a fun little exercise. Hoping to add new pages to the site soon.</p>
                <p>Specs page: added some new machines and tweaked the listings for a few more. I've got a REALLY fun Mac coming in very soon and can't wait to add that one, but for now, this is where we're at.</p>
                <p>Misc: Updated my name across the pages again! I'll settle on one eventually, I swear. Also, for that reason, I've elected to stop retroactively changing my name on older blog posts. I've restored them to what my name was at that time.</p>
                <p>That's all for now. I'm finishing up my senior year of high school, and maybe after that I'll have a bit more time to work on things.</p>
                <p>Ruby out.</p>
