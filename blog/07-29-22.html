                <h1>Where Have I Been?! - July 29, 2022</h1>
              <p> Howdy hey, everyone. It's been far too long, hasn't it? I've got a lot to talk about, but I'm gonna try to keep it brief.</p>
              <p>As you may know, during the month of June, I failed to deliver on almost anything I promised. Unfortunately, burnout hit super hard, and I wasn't able to make myself produce anything of note.</p>
              <p>WWDC was fine. I returned the MacBook Pro after sticker shock finally settled in. Not much else happened after that.</p>
              <p>I am sorry about the broken promises. I did intend to create new things, but ultimately the energy just was not there. So, that out of the way, where have I been?</p>
              <h1>Virtual reality, of course!</h1>
              <p>That's right, baby! Throughout the entirety of the past few months, I have immersed myself in the world of VR. More specifically, VRChat, a platform that I held very dearly to my heart. As I write this, we are hot off the heels of an incredibly controversial moment in VRChat history, but I have my own thoughts about that that will most likely appear in a seperate blog post sometime soon.</p>
              <p>But, it's been a fun time nonetheless. I spent the second half of June doing non-stop VRChat marathon streaming, ultimately allowing me to upgrade to a Valve Index headset, and ever since it's been a very important part of my life. I'm actually still heavily considering pivoting my entire brand to solely being a VR streamer who happens to have a Live2D model, but I'm still not entirely sure. Time will tell when I return to streaming, since I have taken a break from that as well for the sake of my health.</p>
              <p>I figured I'd update on some personal projects. Here on the Jukebox, there have been some minor updates, but nothing particularly noteworthy. In the world of streaming, I still have some donation incentives to meet, like a Metal Gear Rising stream and VR Week. And, in my spare time, I am still trying to find the words for the Anamanaguchi retrospective that I teased months and months ago.</p>
              <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XYBtHAdvNrU">If  you're so inclined, I spent half an hour on stream rambling about why I love virtual reality so much. It's a very heartfelt video, clipped from a stream (please pardon the audio), and I highly recommend giving it a watch if you have any interest in the way a virtual space can have such a profound impact on a physical existence.</a></p>
              <p>Otherwise, I don't have much else to say. Thank you for reading this. I hope by the time it goes live I'll have a second post to accompany it.</p>
              <p>Until next time.</p>
              <p>Amber out.</p>
