                <h1>Update Log: August 30, 2022</h1>
                  <p>It's time for an update!</p>
                  <p>Hello everyone! I hope you all are doing well. I've gone and updated some things, as I'm getting ready to put a bit more time into this site again. I spent most of the changes focused on performance, but I've also reverted a few changes as well!</p>
                  <h1>Changelog</h1>
                  <span class=spanlist><ul>
                    <li>Fonts are now hosted on-site, and won't prevent the page from loading anymore</li>
                    <li>Background image is now hosted on-site, and has been compressed by ~60% (1.5MB to 450KB)</li>
                    <li>Chatbox has been removed, and replaced with an updated version of the old bio sidebar</li>
                    <li>To account for this, the visitor count has been moved back to the sidebar</li>
                    <li>The guestbook has had a style update to mesh better with the Jukebox</li>
                    <li>A few time-specific posts have been removed from the blog</li>
                    <li>Minor text adjustments on the music and games pages</li>
                    <li>Adjusted content alignment on several pages</li>
                  </ul></span>
                  <h1>The future ahead</h1>
                  <p>That's all the changes for this update, but over the coming weeks I aim to update the Jukebox fairly significantly. I'd like to maybe give it an aesthetic refresh, although I'm not sure on that.</p>
                  <p>What I mainly seek to do is optimize the site more, making it quicker to load and quicker to work on. I'd love to get in the flow of updating the Jukebox more regularly, and adding more content to explore and interact with.</p>
                  <p>I've had a severe lack of energy in my life lately, but I'm slowly learning to love being creative again. I have a fun trip coming up that I plan on documenting here, so stay tuned in the coming days for some new posts on that.</p>
                  <p>Thank you for reading. Until next time.</p>
                  <p>Amber out.</p>
