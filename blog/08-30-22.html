                <h1>Update Log: August 30, 2022</h1>
                  <p> I'm gonna keep it real with all of you. I had a much larger changelog written, but for whatever reason, my site decided it no longer wanted to deploy. So I've spent the past few hours doing nothing but slowly adding and removing and re-adding files to see what was breaking things. I think I have it under control now, but dear lord that was exhausting.</p>
                  <p>Anyways, changes. Right. I already wrote this changelog, but it seems that said changelog caused deployment issues. So, here it is again, but in a different format.</p>
                  <h1>Changelog</h1>
                  <p>The chatbox has been removed, and replaced with a modified version of the old right sidebar. To compliment this, the guestbook page has had a small revamp, and the stylesheet has been updated. The visitor count has also been moved back to the sidebar instead of on the homepage.</p>
                  <p>Some small adjustments on the music and games pages have been made to bring them in line with the current design (mostly spacing adjustments).</p>
                  <p>In the future, the blog will be more easily automated, allowing me to add posts faster, and also hopefully maybe preventing this stupid issue. I'm sorry for everyone who tried to visit in the few hours the site wasn't working. The files were literally gone. My deploy action deleted them.</p>
                  <h1>Looking ahead</h1>
                  <p>I'm gonna try to give the Jukebox some more attention in the upcoming weeks. I have some things I'd like to do, and I think it'd be fun.</p>
                  <p>Also, I'm headed on a trip across the country soon (hi, Ashe!), and I'll be trying to keep a log of that as it happens. So that's exciting. Stay tuned.</p>
                  <p>I swear to god, this post better make it to your eyes. I'm so tired. I'd like to sleep.</p>
                  <p>Until next time. Good night.</p>
                  <p>Amber out.</p>
