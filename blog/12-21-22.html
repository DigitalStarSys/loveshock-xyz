                <h1>Update Log: December 21, 2022 </h1>
                <p>Hello hello, readers. Hope you're all having a good holiday season. We wanted to fill you in on some updates regarding us and The Jukebox, so we hope you'll give this a read.</p>
                <h1>Wait, "we"?</h1>
                <p>That's right! Hi, nice to meet you - we're plural.</p>
                <p>We'll be explaining more about this in a future post, but we've recently discovered our own plurality, and have decided to update the Jukebox to reflect this.</p>
                <p>We're the Loveshock System, comprised of Amber (she/xe/it) and Koda (it/she). Amber has been the one maintaining the Jukebox for the past two years, and we're excited for you all to hopefully maybe meet Koda sometime.</p>
                <p>Anyways, here's what was updated.</p>
                <h1>Changelog</h1>
                <span>
                <ul class=spanlist>
                  <li>The home page was updated to reflect both of us.</li>
                  <li>Navigation sections have been renamed.</li>
                  <li>Bio sidebar has been updated to reflect both of us.</li>
                  <li>Removed Twitter button from most pages.</li>
                  <li>The about page has been rewritten.</li>
                  <li>The tech and games pages have been minorly updated.</li>

                  <li>Mixcloud link removed.</li>
                 </ul>
                </span>
                <h1>The future</h1>
                <p>We'll be posting a new post about our plurality soon enough. It's scary for us, and we're not sure how it will be received, but regardless, we're excited to finally be able to truly open up to the world. We hope the Jukebox will continue to be a safe, warm spot for everyone who stops by, and we'll continue to do our best to keep it that way.</p>
                <p>We do need to find a new exit signature, though...</p>
                <p>Until next time.</p>
                <p>LS out.</p>
