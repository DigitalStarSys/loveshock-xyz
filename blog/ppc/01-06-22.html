                <h1>PPC Challenge: Day 1</h1>
              		<p>Day one of the PowerPC challenge is underway.</p>
                    <p>What is there to say so far? Not much, really. Day one only really consists of a few hours, since the challenge only begins once MacYak for that week ends, which leaves very little to report for day one. I spent most of my time downloading music via Soulseek to listen to in iTunes - I spent my Sunday ripping my CD collection to the Mac, and I can’t get Navidrome to reliably download files to my system from my server via InterWebPPC. I might be able to scp the music files straight from the server, but I’m not sure if this Mac’s security protocols are able to communicate with my DigitalOcean droplet.</p>
                    <p>However, I did start the challenge a bit early - I watched this week’s episode of MacYak on my G5! Using PPCMC to play the stream at 360p, I opened chat as a pop-up in Safari and talked that way. It wasn’t...the smoothest experience, but it worked, which is what counts! After stream ended, I logged into TinkerDifferent and posted for the first time there, which was a bit of a hassle since Safari didn’t want to send my posts but InterWeb wanted to take three thousand years to load the website.</p>
                    <p>Tomorrow, I’ll likely see if I can install Adelie Linux on this thing, per Action Retro’s suggestion. That’d be a fun time - apparently KDE with this rig is pretty responsive. That’d be an interesting experiment!</p>
                    <p>So far, I’m already feeling a bit of loneliness. My Mastodon instance has been down all day, so I can’t talk there, Twitter runs at 3 seconds per frame when logging in, and Discord notifications don’t work the same so I don’t post there as often either. Maybe I’ll post on SpaceHey instead. I don’t know. Definitely feel the “away from social media” anxiety, but hopefully that will subdue. Maybe I’ll even be happier to step away from it when the challenge is over.</p>
                    <p>I gotta figure out how to get this posted to the blog, though. I might have to use the Neocities web editor, I’m not sure if Dreamweaver is gonna work with my HTML files. Just have to wait and see, I suppose!</p>
                    <p>That’s all I’ve got for day 1. Excited for day 2 to try and do more things.</p>
                    <p>Amber out.</p>
