                <h1>PPC Challenge: Day 3</h1>
              		<p>Practically nothing much happened today. At all.</p>
                  <p>I got out of bed at about 2pm, ate lunch, and then got back into bed and just watched YouTube on my phone. I did not feel like doing anything, and as such, I barely touched my Mac. Or my desk at all. I didn't even write anything. I'm posting this late. I wrote this on the 9th.</p>
                  <p>Day 4, of which the log is coming out early because my brain is running rampant with thoughts as of right now, will have much more content.</p>
                  <p>I did find a cool new website called reFlash, though. I'll be putting a button to it in the other sitez section soon.</p>
                  <p>Amber out.</p>
