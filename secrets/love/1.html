        <p>You'll never read this.</p>
        <p>I never got around to publishing it in time.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't change how I feel, or how I felt when  I wrote this.</p>
        <p>If you do find this, and read it. Thank you. I'm sorry.</p>

        <p>Our circumstances for meeting were rather unusual</p>
        <p>A connection made unknowingly, blissfully unaware</p>
        <p>Innocent on the surface, the truth hiding beneath</p>
        <p>The first day, filled with awkward silence</p>
        <p>On the back of a split partnership, one more couldn't hurt</p>
        <p>Followed by a night of words, flirtations in the absence of a gem</p>
        <p>Familiar friends, the days after echoing the same sentiments.</p>
        <p> * </p>
        <p>The night everything changed</p>
        <p>A cozy concept, digitally realized</p>
        <p>A clock halfway, the time melting</p>
        <p>You were there too, laughing along</p>
        <p>Risky endeavours, brought forth by exhaustion</p>
        <p>Emotions became louder, questions forming in our heads</p>
        <p>Waking up from it all, the days after feeling like heaven.</p>
        <p> * </p>
        <p>A sky filled with hope</p>
        <p>Time set aside, to realize the impossible</p>
        <p>The tears in our eyes, a compliment to a loving tackle</p>
        <p>A hopeful adventure, destination unknown</p>
        <p>A kiss never felt before, weight off our shoulders</p>
        <p>A hand never held before, the soft touch of a new day</p>
        <p>Our bodies intertwined, together at last.</p>
        <p> * </p>
        <p>I didn't want to say goodbye</p>
        <p>The sound of your voice, blending into the footsteps</p>
        <p>The bright white lights, blocked by your shoulder</p>
        <p>An offer unaccepted, one final smile</p>
        <p>Your face fading away, one step at a time</p>
        <p>A warm memory, holding onto my heart</p>
        <p>The sun sets, to bring forth a new life.</p>
