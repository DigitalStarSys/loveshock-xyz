                        <h1>The Story</h1>
                        <p>Originally starting life long ago as a machine named "Kohaku", Prometheus is our trusty desktop gaming rig that powers our personal gaming as well as our streaming.</p>
                        <p>It's undergone several renovations to become a Ship of Theseus of sorts, as the only parts it shares in common with the original Kohaku system are it's NVMe SSD and 3TB games drive. Said parts moved from Kohaku, a Xeon workstation, to "Kohaku ~Append~"", powered by a Ryzen 5 3600. In 2022, Kohaku ~Append~ saw it's motherboard and CPU replaced by the ASRock Z790 PG SONIC, thus earning the new name "Kohaku: SUPERSONIC".</p>
                        <p>However, after a new GPU purchase rendered the old case obsolete, Kohaku: SUPERSONIC got a renaming to Prometheus, to better fit its new appearance.</p>
                        <p>The heart of Kohaku lived on until July of 2023, when her original games drive finally kicked the bucket, where it was replaced with the WD_BLACK SN850X. There are no original parts of Kohaku remaining inside Prometheus.</p>
